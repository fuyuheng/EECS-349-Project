<p>In this project, my task is to predict the crime rate in Chicago in a certain day given the weather parameters in that day. In a more fundamental level, I wish to investigate the relationship between weather and crime rate, if there is any. The motivation for this project emerges from my experience with Chicagoâ€™s weather since my attendance at Northwestern. I have noticed significance effect of weather on my mood and behavior, so have my close friends in Northwestern. I wish to further explore this effect in a more quantified and rigorous manner, and I decided to use crimes as the specific measurement of human behavior (specifically, how violent human turn to each other). Important applications may arise if the model can predict crimes in Chicago in reasonable accuracy from weather. The effect of weather on crime can be a valuable addition to the existing crime-predicting tools such as <a href="https://www.predpol.com/technology/">PREDPOL</a> to achieve greater accuracy in predicting crimes, enabling law enforcement agencies to stop crimes better, faster, or even before they happen. The prediction made by the program can also be used in other psychological or sociological studies on weather and human behaviors to gain further insights.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
