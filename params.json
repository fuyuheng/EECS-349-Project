{"name":"Predicting Crimes In Chicago From Weather","tagline":"Alan Fu (yuhengfu2017@u.northwestern.edu)","body":"### Problem\r\nIn this project, my task is to predict the crime rate in Chicago in a certain day given the weather parameters in that day. In a more fundamental level, I wish to investigate the relationship between weather and crime rate, if there is any. The motivation for this project emerges from my experience with Chicagoâ€™s weather since my attendance at Northwestern. I have noticed significance effect of weather on my mood and behavior, so have my close friends in Northwestern. I wish to further explore this effect in a more quantified and rigorous manner, and I decided to use crimes as the specific measurement of human behavior (specifically, how violent human turn to each other).\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nThis project is conducted by **Alan Fu** (yuhengfu2017@u.northwestern.edu), a sophomore computer science and physics double major student from **Northwestern University**, for the class _EECS 349 (Machine Learning)_. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
